## Description
This project this is a react.js portfolio by Explore the links and portfolio.  My motivation for this project was to to showcase different rendering for react.js on the front end.
I wanted to solve the problem of by rendering different react components on the same webpage.  I learned components in react take in javascript code in different ways and combine elements of html and css for styling purposes.  I also learned about props and how easy it is to use seperate different sections of a website using reacts' amazing rendering abilities.
